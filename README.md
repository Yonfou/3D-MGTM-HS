# 3D-MGTM-HS
## 3D Magnetic Gradient Tensor Modeling at High Susceptibility

by Ouyang Fang, and Longwei Chen

This repository contains the manuscripts and supplementary code for a paper about the open-source software package 3D-MGTM-HS. It also describes an optimal method for 3D magnetic gradient tensor modeling due to its applicability for high magentic susceptibility .

The 3D-MGTM-HS package is written in the FORTRAN programming language and has no external dependencies. 

The manuscript has been published in the journal Minerals on October 2021, and a relevant manuscript can also be found in the journal Geophysics on the January-February 2020 issue.
